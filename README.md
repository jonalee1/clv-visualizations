## 🔍 Key Interactive CLV Modules  

### 🏛 Traditional CLV Model  
Dive into **deterministic CLV calculations** based on fixed churn rates. Explore basic, growth, and segment models, then see how they stack up against **probabilistic approaches** for a more dynamic prediction.  

### ⏳ Lifetime Model  
Visualize **customer retention patterns** with heterogeneous churn rates. Discover the **Beta-Geometric model**, which produces realistic survival curves compared to traditional exponential models.  

### 📈 Purchase Frequency Model  
Compare **Poisson vs. Negative Binomial distributions** to model purchase frequency. See why **customer heterogeneity matters** when crafting accurate predictions.  

### 💰 Monetary Value Model  
Explore how the **Gamma-Gamma mixture model** characterizes transaction patterns and captures spending variability—both across customers and within individual purchase behaviors.  

### 🔗 Unified Probabilistic CLV Model  
Bring it all together! Dive into the **BG/NBD/GG framework**, which integrates retention, frequency, and monetary value models for comprehensive CLV predictions.

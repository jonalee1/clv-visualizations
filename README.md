Explore Customer Lifetime Value

These interactive tools help you understand the mathematical models behind probabilistic customer lifetime value (CLV) predictions and how different factors impact the long-term value of customers.

Each visualization allows you to manipulate model parameters in real-time to see their effects on customer behavior patterns and value forecasts.

1. Traditional CLV Models
Understand traditional deterministic CLV calculations based on fixed churn rates, including basic, growth, and segment models. Compare with probabilistic approaches.

2. Lifetime Model
Visualize customer retention patterns with heterogeneous churn rates. See how the Beta-Geometric model creates more realistic survival curves compared to traditional exponential retention models.

3. Purchase Frequency Model
Compare Poisson vs. Negative Binomial distributions for modeling purchase frequency. See why accounting for customer heterogeneity creates more accurate predictions.

4. Monetary Value Model
Explore how Gamma-Gamma mixture characterizes transaction patterns and capture spending variability, both between-customer heterogeneity and within-customer purchase variation.

5. Unified Probabilistic CLV Model
Explore the combination of three probabilistic models (BG/NBD/GG) to create a comprehensive CLV prediction. Understand retention, frequency, and monetary value components.
